    "# Reflectometry Analysis Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by working through a simple example of a neutron reflectometry analysis. \n",
    "This example doesn't have a specific life science application, but it is a good system to start with. \n",
    "We will use the Python library [`refnx`](https://refnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and this Jupyter Notebook to analyse our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Learning Outcomes \n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain how `refnx` and Python can be used to analyse reflectometry data.\n",
    "- Interpret the results of a reflectometry analysis. \n",
    "- Understand the use of optimisation and sampling in reflectometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will investigate is from a polymer brush system; while not biological, it is an excellent demonstrative example. \n",
    "The data were collected at the Platypus reflectometer at the ANTSO reactor source in Australia. \n",
    "The data are stored as four columns ASCII files, with the columns representing the *q*-vectors, the measured reflectivity, the uncertainty in the measured reflectivity, and the width of a Gaussian resolution function. \n",
    "The specific system that we are investigating can be described with the following layers: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "|-----Silicon-----|\n",
    "|-----------------|\n",
    "|---Polymer Film--|\n",
    "|-----------------|\n",
    "|-------D2O-------|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at a single neutron measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with reading the data and having a look at it. \n",
    "We will use the `ReflectDataset` class from `refnx` to do this. "
